POST-INSTALLATION SCRIPTS
=========================

Any scripts located in this directory will be executed after the installation
process on the target machine. The scripts will be executed in random order, 
so there should be no script that depends on a prior to be executed before
itself. In a later version of this KS-GENERATOR, there may be a way to setup
dependencies between scripts. 

A script will NOT be included unless it has a proper header shebang. The most
common headers for scripts can be found here. 

| Language  |      Shebang Style       |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Bash      | `#!/usr/bin/bash`        |
| Shell     | `#!/usr/bin/sh`          |
| C-shell   | `#!/usr/bin/csh`         |
| Python 2  | `#!/usr/bin/env python2` |
| Python 3  | `#!/usr/bin/env python3` |
| Perl      | `#!/usr/bin/env perl`    |
