SETTING UP KICKSTART DEPLOYMENT
===============================

SIMPLEST METHOD
---------------

Make the compiled KS.CFG avaliable through the local IP range by serving
it through a HTTP web server. 

At boot, TAB-in to modify boot parameters and append the following lines 
to setup kickstart:
	`ip=dhcp inst.ks=http://<YOUR SERVER IP>/<URI TO ACCESS CFG>`
