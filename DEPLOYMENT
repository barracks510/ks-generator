SETTING UP KICKSTART DEPLOYMENT
===============================

SIMPLEST METHOD
---------------

Make the compiled KS.CFG avaliable through the local IP range by serving
it through a HTTP web server. (e.g. nginx or apache). Even though all passwords
are encrypted using the KS-GENERATOR, it may not be safe to release the CFGs
to the world.

```
server {
	listen 80;

	...

	location /ksconfig {
		allow 192.168.1.1/24;
		allow 127.0.0.1;
		deny all;
	}

	...

}
```

At boot, TAB-in to modify boot parameters and append the following lines 
to setup kickstart:
	`ip=dhcp inst.ks=http://<YOUR SERVER IP>/<URI TO ACCESS CFG>`
NOTE: At the CFG must be accessable through a given SERVER IP address. DNS
will NOT be configured at the boot time.
