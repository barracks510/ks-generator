DISK LAYOUT
===========

Advice on Partitions
--------------------

Optimal partition setup depends on the usage for the Linux system in question. These tips may help
you decide how to configure your disk space.

Consider encrypting any partitions that might contain sensitive data. Encryption prevents
unauthorized people from accessing the data on the partitions, even if they have access to the
physical storage device. In most cases, you should at least encrypt the /home partition.

Each kernel installed on your system requires approximately 20 MB on the /boot partition. The
default partition size of 500 MB for /boot should suffice for most common uses; increase the size
of this partition if you plan to keep many kernels installed at the same time.

The /var directory holds content for a number of applications, including the Apache web server.
It also is used to store downloaded update packages on a temporary basis. Ensure that the
partition containing the /var directory has enough space to download pending updates and
hold your other content.

If you create a separate partition for /var, ensure that it is at least 3GB in size to
accomodate downloaded package updates.

The /usr directory holds the majority of software content on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.
For an installation of the default set of software, allocate at least 5 GB of space. If the system will
be used as a software development workstation, allocate at least 10GB.

SWAP
----

| Amount of RAM   |    Recommended swap     | Recommended swap if hibernating |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| less than 2 GB  | 2.0 x the amount of RAM | 3.0 x the amount of RAM         |
| 2 GB - 8 GB     | 1.0 x the amount of RAM | 2.0 x the amount of RAM         |
| 8 GB - 64 GB    | 0.5 x the amount of RAM | 1.5 x the amount of RAM         |
| more than 64 GB | workload dependent      | hibernation not recommended     |

At the border between each range listed above (for example, a system with 2 GB, 8 GB, or
64 GB of system RAM), discretion can be exercised with regard to chosen swap space and
hibernation support. If your system resources allow for it, increasing the swap space may
lead to better performance.

Special Considerations
----------------------

Consider leaving a portion of the space in an LVM volume group unallocated. This unallocated
space gives you flexibility if your space requirements change but you do not wish to remove data
from other partitions to reallocate storage. You can also select the Thin provisioning device
type for the partition to have the unused space handled automatically by the volume.

If you separate subdirectories into partitions, you can retain content in those subdirectories if you
decide to install a new version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux over your current system. For instance,
if you intend to run a MySQL database in /var/lib/mysql/, make a separate partition for that
directory in case you need to reinstall later.

On a BIOS system with its boot loader using GPT (GUID partition table), you need to create the
biosboot partition of 1 MB in size. 

UEFI systems need to contain a small partition with a mount point of /boot/efi containing an
EFI System Partition file system. Its recommended size is 200 MB, which is also the default value
for automatic partitioning.
